# Paranoia

Paranoia is an email client for Windows based on the research paper **"Security and usability engineering with particular attention to electronic mail"** published in 
2005 by Volker Roth, Tobias Straub, and Kai Richter.

While PGP has been around since 1991 and has seen a rise in usages after the documents revealed by Edward Snowden the adoption is still very scarce.
One of the reasons, if not the reason, why adoption has failed is the fact that the tools available for the average user are inconvenient at best.
Most of today's agents like Outlook and Thunderbird do already offer encryption in one form or another, however all of them treat it as a second class citizen.
Users need to manually enable, configure and maintain their keychains and or certificate stores, which can be cumbersome, too cumbersome for most people, including me.


The goal of Paranoia is to hide the encryption process from the user while sacrificing as little usability as possible.
While a user is made aware when encryption is being used, he or she does not have to deal with any idiosyncrasies that come with it.
Usual necessities, such as key generation, key exchange, key renewal, keychain management, decryption and encryption are fully automated and do not require any user interaction.
